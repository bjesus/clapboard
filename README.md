# Clapboard - clipboard manager that makes you clap üëè

Clapboard is a simple clipboard manager for Wayland, built in Rust. It saves a history of your clipboard content, and lets you paste things you've copied earlier. It also lets you configure "favorite" pastes for strings you need often. For example, you can set favorites with your address, phone number, email address etc - and they'll all become just a few clicks away. It supports all mime-types and it is agnostic regarding to your choice of menu system (e.g. dmenu, tofi, wofi, rofl etc). You can even easily share your clipboard history across devices.

## Requirements

- [tofi](https://github.com/philj56/tofi) or any other dmenu-like program ([wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi), [rofi](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi), [dmenu](https://github.com/nyyManni/dmenu-wayland))

## Installation

### From source

- `git clone` the repository
- Run `cargo build --release`
- copy the `clapboard` executable to your PATH

### Arch Linux

Clapboard is available on AUR as [clapboard-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/clapboard-git).

## Usage

- `clapboard --record` to record both [PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Clipboard)
- `clapboard` to open the menu

If you're using Sway, just add this to your `~/.config/sway/config`:

```
exec clapboard --record
```

- Optionally, bind some key to run `clapboard`. I'm binding the Favorites key in Sway like this:
```
bindsym XF86Favorites exec clapboard
```

To share the clipboard content between devices, use a tool like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync the Clapboard cache folder (usually at `~/.cache/clapboard`).

## Configuration

Below is the default Clapboard configuration. If you want to change it, create a similar file at `~/.config/clapboard/config.toml`

```toml
launcher = [ "tofi", "--fuzzy-match=true", "--prompt-text=clap: " ]
history_size = 50

[favorites]
# You can add your favorite clipboard pastes here like this:
# "some key" = "some value"
```
